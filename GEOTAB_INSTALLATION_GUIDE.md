   - Navigate to **System Settings ‚Üí Add-Ins**

2. **Add the Configuration**
   Copy and paste this JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "Heat Map - Enhanced",
  "supportEmail": "support@geotab.com",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "items": [{
    "url": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Geotab/sdk-addin-samples@master/addin-heatmap/app/heatmap.html",
    "path": "ActivityLink/",
    "menuName": {
      "en": "Heat Map"
    },
    "icon": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Geotab/sdk-addin-samples@master/addin-heatmap/app/images/icon.svg"
  }],
  "isSigned": false
}
```

3. **Save and Test**
   - Click **Save** to install the add-in
   - Navigate to **Activity ‚Üí Heat Map** to test the add-in

### Method 2: Self-Hosted
If you prefer to host the files on your own server:

   - Upload the entire `addin-heatmap/app/` folder to your web server
   - Ensure the files are accessible via HTTPS

2. **Update Configuration**
     Replace the URL in the configuration with your server URL:
```json
{
  "name": "Heat Map - Self Hosted",
  "supportEmail": "your-email@company.com",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "items": [{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/path/to/heatmap.html",
    "path": "ActivityLink/",
    "menuName": {
      "en": "Heat Map"
    },
    "icon": "https://your-server.com/path/to/images/icon.svg"
